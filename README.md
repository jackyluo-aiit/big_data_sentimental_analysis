Online social media is currently one of the most popular places where people express their opinions. For example, there are millions of active users on Twitter. It is simple, fast and convenient for a person to post or comment a tweet to share his or her views on a certain product, service or anything. This makes Twitter a rich resource for conducting data collection and sentiment analysis.
